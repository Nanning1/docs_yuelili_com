## 描述

Interpolates a value across the currently shaded micropolygon.

```c
float  interpolate(float val, float sx, float sy)
```

```c
vector  interpolate(vector val, float sx, float sy)
```

```c
vector4  interpolate(vector4 val, float sx, float sy)
```

```c
bsdf  interpolate(bsdf val, float sx, float sy)
```

These operations can be used to generate antialiasing positions withinthe
micropolygon rendering engine.

different random positions on the micropolygon.
