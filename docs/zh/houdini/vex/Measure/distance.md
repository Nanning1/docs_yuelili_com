## 描述

Returns the distance between two points.

```c
float  distance(vector2 a, vector2 b)
```

```c
float  distance(vector a, vector b)
```

```c
float  distance(vector4 a, vector4 b)
```

If you want the squared distance, use [distance2](distance2.html "Returns the
squared distance between the two points.") instead of using this and
[pow](pow.html "Raises the first argument to the power of the second
argument.").

If you want the squared distance, usedistance2instead of using this andpow.
