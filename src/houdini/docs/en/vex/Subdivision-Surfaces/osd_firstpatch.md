## Description

`int osd_firstpatch(<geometry>geometry, int face_id)`

## Arguments

`<geometry>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle SOP), this argument
can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the
geometry from.

Alternatively, the argument can be a string specifying a geometry file (for
example, a `.bgeo`) to read from. When running inside Houdini, this can be an
`op:/path/to/sop` reference.

For a given face in the coarse mesh, this returns the number of the first
patch associated with the face. Since each face in a hull may generate
multiple patches, this function will return the first of the patches generated
by the face. ## See also [osd_patchcount](osd_patchcount.html) to find out the
number of patches generated by the face.
